# Business Intelligence Development Project

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution for a client's sales data. The client provided a CSV file containing a wide table with all available sales data. The objective was to clean, transform, and analyze the data to derive meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) for informed decision-making.


## Key Steps![PBIDesktop_5trJjkw1J6](https://github.com/alm-safwat/BI-Sales-Analytics-Powering-Decisions-with-Data-driven-Insights/assets/135442913/a4fcbb33-b528-4057-9797-a1381b0dbb0c)


1. **Understanding the Business**: Spent time understanding the client's business operations, goals, and required KPIs from the sales data.

2. **Data Preparation**:
    - Used Power Query to clean and transform the raw data from the CSV file.
    - Formatted the data for optimal analysis and visualization.

3. **Data Warehousing**:
    - Created a Data Warehouse using dimensional modeling techniques.
    - Developed a star schema consisting of:
        - Five dimension tables:
            - DimShipmethod
            - DimStatus
            - DimTerritory
            - DimProduct
            - DimDate
        - One fact table:
            - FactSales

4. **Calculating Measures**:
    - Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI to calculate relevant measures and KPIs based on the client's requirements.

5. **Dashboard Creation**:
    - Developed an interactive and dynamic dashboard using Power BI.
    - Designed visuals and reports to present insights effectively.

6. **Client Delivery**:
    - Delivered the finalized dashboard to the client.
    - Provided recommendations for leveraging data-driven decisions based on the insights derived.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)


## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced analytics techniques, such as predictive modeling, to forecast sales trends.
- Enhance the dashboard with additional interactivity and drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis.
- Implement scheduled data refreshes to keep the dashboard up-to-date with the latest sales data.
